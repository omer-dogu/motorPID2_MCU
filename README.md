motorPID2_MCU is the firmware running on a microcontroller to control a DC motor using a PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) algorithm.
The MCU handles low-level motor control tasks such as reading encoder feedback, computing real-time RPM, applying PID updates, generating PWM signals, and managing communication frames over UART.

This repository contains the full embedded code responsible for real-time motor regulation and hardware-level control.
